# Kata Containers C-Ray Metrics
This is a test of C-Ray which is a simple raytracer designed to test the floating-point CPU performance.
This test is `multi-threaded`, will shoot 8 rays per `pixel` for `anti-aliasing` and will
generate a 1600 x 1200 image.

## Running the C-Ray test
Individual test can be run by hand, for example: 

``` 
$ cd metrics/disk/c-ray $ ./cray.sh
```
